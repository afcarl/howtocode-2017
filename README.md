# Simple and Efficient Learning w/ Automatic Operation Batching
by Graham Neubig

This is example code from the "How to Code a Paper" workshop at NIPS 2017.
It is based on [DyNet's autobatching](http://dynet.io/autobatch/), and you can take a look at the [Slides](http://phontron.com/slides/neubig17howtocode.pdf) or [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07860) for more details.
